## Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices in Bangalore based on various features such as location, size, total square footage, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various houses in Bangalore, including features like location, size, total square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and price.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShubhamJadhav03/BangloreHousePrice.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd BangloreHousePrice
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open and run the notebook `BangloreHousePricePrediction.ipynb`.

## Model
The model used in this project is a regression model built using scikit-learn. It includes data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The results indicate that the model can effectively predict house prices in Bangalore.
